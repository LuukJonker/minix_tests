Once upon a time there was a lovely
                         princess. But she had an enchantment
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could
                         only be broken by love's first kiss.
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
                         Many brave knights had attempted to
                         free her from this dreadful prison,
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of
                         the tallest tower for her true love
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs)
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What
                         a load of - (toilet flush)

               Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his
               day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go
               after the ogre.

               NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

                                     MAN1
                         Think it's in there?

                                     MAN2
                         All right. Let's get it!

                                     MAN1
                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that
                         thing can do to you?

                                     MAN3
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's
                         bread.

               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                                     SHREK
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse.
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly
                         peeled skin.

                                     MEN
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's
                         quite good on toast.

                                     MAN1
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)

               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the
               men are in the dark.

                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away.
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.)
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted.
                         Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)


               THE NEXT DAY

               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three
               little pigs.

                                     GUARD
                         All right. This one's full. Take it
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!


                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next!

                                     GUARD
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that!
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the
                         broom in half)

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch.
                         Next!

                                     GUARD
                         Get up! Come on!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Twenty pieces.

                                     LITTLE BEAR
                         (crying) This cage is too small.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please!
                         Give me another chance!

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     GIPETTO
                         This little wooden puppet.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his
                         nose grows)

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy.
                         Take it away.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this!
                         Help me!

               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up
               to the table.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings,
                         if you can prove it.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.

               Donkey just looks up at her.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Well?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox.
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
